# Terrycoin: A Decentralized Coin on Polygon

## Introduction

Terrycoin is a decentralized digital currency built on the Polygon network, aiming to provide an efficient and secure way for users to transact and store value. This smart contract has a total supply of 93,700,000,000,000 (93.7 trillion) Terrycoins.

## Smart Contract

The Terrycoin smart contract is designed to manage the creation and distribution of Terrycoins on the Polygon network. It is developed using Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

### Contract Address

The Terrycoin smart contract is deployed on the Polygon network. The contract address can be found on the [Polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/) explorer.

### Contract Features

- **Total Supply:** The Terrycoin contract has a fixed supply of 93,700,000,000,000 Terrycoins. This amount is determined at the time of contract deployment and cannot be changed.
- **Transfer:** Users can send Terrycoins to other addresses on the Polygon network. The transfer function in the smart contract ensures that the sender has enough balance and updates the balances of both the sender and the receiver.
- **Balance:** Users can check their Terrycoin balance by calling the `balanceOf` function with their address as a parameter.
- **Events:** The Terrycoin contract emits events for every transaction, such as transfers and contract deployments, to facilitate tracking and auditing.

### Deployment

The Terrycoin smart contract is deployed on the Polygon network using the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/).

## Getting Started

To start using Terrycoin, you will need a Polygon-compatible wallet, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), and a small amount of MATIC tokens for gas fees.

1. Set up your Polygon-compatible wallet and add the Polygon network to it.
2. Send some MATIC tokens to your wallet address to cover gas fees.
3. Install a Polygon-compatible browser extension or use a Polygon-enabled dApp browser, such as [Polygon Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polygon-wallet/hudgfjhifbppfjdbabibakjfndhjagc?hl=en).
4. Navigate to the Terrycoin smart contract address on the Polygon network using the Polygon Wallet browser.
5. Interact with the Terrycoin contract functions, such as checking your balance or transferring Terrycoins.

## Conclusion

Terrycoin is a decentralized digital currency built on the Polygon network, offering a secure and efficient way to transact and store value. With a total supply of 93.7 trillion Terrycoins, the smart contract ensures a fair distribution of the currency and provides a robust foundation for its future growth.
